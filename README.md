# Terraform and Ansible

**Setting up AWS account for Terraform**
1. Create access key and secret key for an AWS user
2. install aws CLI on you machine
3. run below commands to configure AWS account on your machine and enter the access key and secret key
    '''aws config'''

**Setting up Azure account for Terraform:**
1. Install azure cli on your machine
2. follow instruction on https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/service_principal_client_secret to create azure client id, client_secret.

**Setting up GCP account for Terraform**
1. Create service account on gcp and download the credentials on your local file
2. Provide credentails in your provider.tf

**Creating public and private key for SSH:**
1. Create a public and private key using below command
    """ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096"""
2. Enter the file name for more security add paraphrase
3. Never share your private key.

**Deploying a multiple EC2 instance which allows SSH into them:**
1. Modify the ec2.tf file accounding to the requirements

**Deploying a VM instance on Azure which allows SSH into them:**
1. Modify the vm.tf file accounding to the requirements

**Deploying a VM instance on GCP which allows SSH into them:**
1. Modify the cloud_compute.tf file accounding to the requirements



***Note: All secret variables stored in Secret.tf file***


***Deploying the scripts:***
1. run below commands
    '''terraform plan'''
    '''terraform apply'''
2. To delete the resources 
    '''terraform destroy'''

**Real-Time S3 and EC2 Synchronization with Terraform and Ansible**

1. Creation of EC2 instances and setting AWS for terraform is similar creating EC2 using terraform related scripts - ec2.tf, provider.tf
2. To create S3 bucket please go through the s3.tf file make sure the bucket has public access
3. To configure s3 to ec2 instances we need to use Ansible. 
4. To create inventory.ini in dynamically go through update_inventory.py(this python script is used to get ip address of the ec2 instances generated by terraform)
5. store your aws credentials in aws_credentails.sh to configure them in EC2s
6. link_s3_ec2.yml and link_s3_ubuntu.yml are used to configure ec2s
7. script.sh is used to run all the above files

***test the project:***
1. chmod +x script.sh
2. chmod +x  aws_credentails.sh
3. source script.sh
4. upload a file into your s3 bucket. SSH into one of the ec2 instances, within 30 seconds the file gets populated in /mnt/s3bucket and to  view logs /var/log/s3_sync.log
